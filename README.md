## About the project
Cake Mood was a small project I started after finishing college.  
When I had to do the final project for the Web Development course, I decided that I wanted to do something with real life aplication so I thought about what I needed for Cake Mood.  

First, I created a webpage for people to see what Cake Mood could do and if they want to place an order.  
Second, I created an app to manage orders.

In short, what i did for this project was:
- HTML and CSS webpage
  - A window for clients see what Cake Mood can make
- C++ app
  - An app for Cake Mood  colaborator's see orders and make new ones
- A database with SQL
  - 1st table - Store all the orders
  - 2nd table - Apps's login
- PHP
  - Connection to the server
