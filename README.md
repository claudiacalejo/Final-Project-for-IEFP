## About the project
Cake Mood was a small project I started after finishing college. 

When I had to do the final project for the Web Development course, I decided that I wanted to do something with real life aplication so I thought about what I needed for Cake Mood.

First, I created a webpage for people to see what CaKe Mood could do and if they want to place an order.

Second, I created an app to manage orders

In short, what i did for this project was:
- An HTML and CSS webpage
  - A window for clients see what Cake Mood can make
- A database with SQL
  - 1st table - Store all the orders
  - 2nd table - Apps's login
- PHP
- C++
